This repository contains data released as supplementary material to the
following paper:
"Validation of open-source science tools and background model construction in
gamma-ray astronomy"
(L. Mohrmann et al., accepted in A&A, 2019)

The data comprise three-dimensional model templates for the residual cosmic-ray
background in all observations that are part of the first H.E.S.S. public test
data release (see https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/dl3-dr1).

The templates are stored in FITS files in the "data" sub-directory. A HDU table
indexing all files is contained in "hdu-index.fits.gz".

The file also contains a python script that, if provided with the location of
the public H.E.S.S. data set, will copy the background model FITS files into
that directory and generate an updated hdu-index.fits.gz file. It should be
executed the following way:
python update_hess_dl3_dr1_hdu_index.py /path/to/this/dir /path/to/hess/dr1/data
(Note that the `astropy` package needs to be installed for this script to work.)

The files have been prepared following the data format definitions specified at
this page:
