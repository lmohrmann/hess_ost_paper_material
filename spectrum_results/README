This repository contains data released as supplementary material to the
following paper:
"Validation of open-source science tools and background model construction in
gamma-ray astronomy"
(L. Mohrmann et al., accepted in A&A, 2019)

The data comprise tabulated results of the spectral analyses performed in the
paper. For each analysis, the results of a power-law fit as well as spectral
points are available.

The results are stored in ASCII text files that follow the following naming
scheme:
    <analysis_tool>_<source>_<analysis_type>_<result_type>.dat

Here,
- <analysis_tool> can be one of
    - "hap": HAP, a H.E.S.S.-internal analysis software program
    - "ctools": ctools (v1.6.0), see http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools
    - "gammapy": Gammapy (v0.12), see https://gammapy.org
- <source> can be one of
    - "crab": the Crab nebula
    - "msh1552": MSH 15-52
    - "pks2155": PKS 2155-304
    - "rxj1713": RX J1713.7-3946
- <analysis_type> can be one of
    - "1d": 1D spectral analysis using the reflected background method
    - "3d": 3D template analysis
      (Note: for "msh1552" as <source>, use "3d_disk" or "3d_excess" to
       distinguish between the results for the two different source models
       employed. See the paper for more details.)
- <result_type> can be one of
    - "powerlaw": Best-fit parameters of the fitted power-law model
    - "spectral_points": Best-fit values for the spectral points

The files giving the results of the power-law fits are structured as follows:

# Phi [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]  # Delta Phi [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]  # Gamma        # Delta Gamma  # E_0 [TeV]
<value>                 <value>                       <value>        <value>        <value>

"Phi" and "Gamma" are the two fitted parameters of the power-law model, with
corresponding (68% CL) uncertainties "Delta Phi" and "Delta Gamma". "E_0"
gives the pivot energy, which is kept fixed in the fit.

The files giving the spectral points are structured as follows:

# E [TeV]      # E low [TeV]  # E high [TeV] # Phi [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]  # Phi low [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]  # Phi high [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1] # UL
<value>        <value>        <value>        <value>                 <value>                     <value>                     <0/1>
<value>        <value>        <value>        <value>                 <value>                     <value>                     <0/1>
...

Each row corresponds to one spectral point. The first three columns ("E",
"E low", and "E high") specify the energies of the spectral points, with their
lower and upper bounds. The next three columns ("Phi", "Phi low", and
"Phi high") give the best-fit flux with the corresponding uncertainty interval
(68% CL). The last column ("UL") can be "0" or "1" and specifies whether a
flux upper limit was derived for this energy ("Phi low" and "Phi high" are set
to "-1" in this case).
